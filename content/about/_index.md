Hi! My name is Alex (he/him), and I am an antidisciplinary person/thing (engineer, artist, teacher, learner, etc.) with a degree in Experience Design from the project-based [Olin College of Engineering](https://www.olin.edu/). Since graduating, I've been living in NYC, managing tiny mobile museum nonprofit [MICRO](https://micro.ooo/) and teaching kids at a [STEAM makerspace](https://www.makeinspires.com/).

I believe that wherever we go and whatever we do, we always have the opportunity to learn and grow. Everything I do is in service of helping people be their best selves: Curious, passionate, and connected. In this portfolio, you can see some of the projects I've worked on across the design lifecycle: From specific and personalized products to large-scale design solutions and everything in between, with a particular interest in education and public communication. Check out my [resume](/Alex%20Luna%20-%20General%20Resume%202024.pdf) for more work experiences.

In my free time, I make and think about art and objects. I love zines, experimental electronic music, sculpture, and traditional art mediums. I am always interested in learning new things!
