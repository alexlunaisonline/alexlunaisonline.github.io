A comic that intuitively teaches the concept of limits and asymptotic behavior to young (elementary-school and older) students through the story of Flat Stanley playing Limbo. [Read online here!](https://flatstan.netlify.app/)

**The Goal:** Identify a remote-friendly intervention that introduces mathematics concepts for early learners.

**The Outcome:** A web-accessible child-friendly introduction to the calculus concept of limits. Using a simple but familiar narrative to engage curiosity about behavior at mathematical extremes.

**My Role:** Researcher, co-writer and illustrator.

**The Process:** 

We collaborated with several educators during the remote learning period of 2020. During our research, we identified that calculus concepts, despite being considered advanced and reserved for high-school or college age, [are easily grasped by young learners when taught in an intuitive way](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/03/5-year-olds-can-learn-calculus/284124/). 

Focusing on the idea of math as the study of patterns, and on visual storytelling as a means of presenting patterns, we decided to tell the story of "Flat Stanley" playing Limbo--With the bar being halved in distance each time, our (infinitely) flat protagonist is always able to slide under it. I built upon my experience as an illustrator and comics artist to create a playful and inviting visual story that connects easy-to-understand concepts with more advanced math vocabulary.
