**The Goal:** Create a play experience for 4th graders that is inspired by the real-life behavior and morphology of an animal within a tight timeline.

**The Outcome:** A game that teaches students about rhinoceros beetles' uniquely adapted horns, which are used to joust and fight to claim territory and attract mates.

**The Process:**

Through a voting process, we were assigned rhinoceros beetles as our organism of interest. We researched the animals' behavior and structure, as well as details on children and play habits. We also investigated existing games and toys inspired by rhinoceros beetles, working to understand prior arts.

We brainstormed and then used a decision matrix to narrow down our ideas. Once we settled on a central game mechanic of manipulating objects with a horn helmet, we focused on building mechanisms that would be fun as well as functional. In the end, our game was well-enjoyed by our players!
