**The Goal:** To identify a challenge in our stakeholder’s life, and then design and fabricate a high-quality, personalized solution.

**The Outcome:** A professional-grade bag that allows our stakeholder, Linda, to carry her oxygen tank. The bag replaced her previous carrying options, which didn't suit her lifestyle, were ill-fitting, fragile, and bulky.

**My Role:** Our team did not assign strict roles, and we each contributed to the design process equally. Research, ideation, and prototyping were all collaborative efforts. However, I was especially responsible for documentation and note-taking, interviewing, and graphic organization.

**The Process:** Our entire process is documented on Olin’s website [here](https://courses.olin.edu/e4h/stories/Team%20Linda:%20Their%20Full%20Journey).

We began by learning about Linda and observing her daily life, noting her interests, passions, and challenges. Linda had been using supplemental oxygen to breathe for 15 years, carrying an 8-pound tank with her everywhere she went in her busy life. She had several options for carrying the tank, most often using a backpack, but each brought their own issues.

After exploring several solutions to increase the ease of her oxygen therapy, we decided to fabricate a new backpack that would take into account her specific goals and needs. Over the course of several iterative design exercises, we determined the major priorities in function, interactions, and aesthetics. We referenced existing options, made sketch models and prototypes, and consulted Linda during each step of the process.

The final bag features a flip-top cover that makes it easy for her to insert and remove the tank and access the full length of her tubing without snags or bends. Specifically designed to fit her tanks, it is padded and minimizes excess space outside of the tank, reduces load on her shoulders, and has a sturdy base to prevent the tank from falling over. It is sleek and stylish, matching with her outfits and not appearing overtly medical, but also communicating important information about the flammability of its contents. This new bag is one she proudly wears every day.
