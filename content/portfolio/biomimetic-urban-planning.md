*Keywords: Urban planning, Research, Biology, Design*

**The Goal:** Synthesize biological models of behavior and mechanics to propose an improvement to an urban planning challenge.

**The Outcome:** Envisioned a model of a walkable city that emphasizes responsiveness and emergent patterns of behavior, challenging car-centric design. Inspirations: Ants, Trees, Slime molds

**My Role:** Research, ideation, graphic design and illustration

**Highlighted Methods, Frameworks, and Skills:**
- Interpreting research
- Persona creation
- [The Biomimicry Toolbox](https://toolbox.biomimicry.org/)
- [Nature's 10 Unifying Principles](https://toolbox.biomimicry.org/core-concepts/natures-unifying-patterns/)

**The Process:** Identified challenges, identified biological models, considered biologically-inspired solutions, integrated solutions into a single unified vision of city planning.
