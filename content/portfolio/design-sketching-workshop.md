**The Goal:** Create open-source, remote-friendly curriculum to teach STEAM concepts to a K12 audience.

**The Outcome:** Multiple runs of a 1.5hr workshop that introduces design sketching and encourages "non-artist" students to practice visual communication. Pairs with [a workshop that teaches paper prototyping skills](http://k12workshops.olin.edu/paper.html).

**My Role:** The entire curriculum was a collaborative effort of research, writing, and presentation with my teammate Evelyn Kessler.

**The Process:** The entire curriculum and slides are available on our [website](http://k12workshops.olin.edu/sketching.html)!

The curriculum was designed over the course of several iterations, honing in on an appropriate scope for our allotted time while focusing on practical design skills for young people. Considering partnerships with youth entrepreneurship groups, we decided on design sketching and visual communication as the topic.

We wanted to demonstrate how using sketching as a means of exploring ideas, rather than as an aesthetic or artistic practice, allows for better communication and the development of more advanced ideas. By using examples from our own personal projects, we could highlight how successful products often start with simple and crude outlines.

Our primary goal was opening students to the idea of sketching as a means of exploring and communicating ideas rather than an exclusively aesthetic practice. By building students' confidence in their ability to represent ideas visually, encouraging them to put pencil to paper in multiple short exercises, we wanted to inspire its adoption as a personal practice. We used numerous examples from our personal projects to demonstrate how design thinking benefited us in our personal and professional lives. We also took time to discuss the mechanics of drawing itself, with tips on ergonomics, like drawing from the arm rather than the wrist. By discussing very fundamental concepts but allowing students the freedom to generate their own ideas, we could tap into our students' personal strengths and allow them to connect with the material in an individualized way.
