**The Goal:** Create a replicable model of community-driven air quality advocacy that identifies air quality issues, strategically installs HEPA filtration systems, and provides data analytics tools to drive legislative action.

**The Outcome:**
- Mapped target locations for a network of strategically-located air quality sensors.
- Developed and ran a series of workshops for installing community-owned air quality sensors in strategic locations.
- Created instructional videos and pamphlets for community involvement.
- Developed data visualization tools for citizens to make informed decisions based on air quality data.
- Developed data visualization tools for long-term legislative advocacy.
- Wrote documentation to support project longevity and handoff.

**My Role:** As the team's Project Manager, I kept track of our deliverables and liaised between the team and stakeholders. I led meetings, organized documentation, and maintained communications. I collaborated with partners to guide our strategy. I additionally led training workshops, helped with our field work, wrote and edited copy, and contributed graphic design for our communications.
