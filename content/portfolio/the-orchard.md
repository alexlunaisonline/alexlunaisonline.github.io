The Orchard is a beautiful, functional, infinitely reconfigurable one-stop hub for information, events, and social gathering at libraries.

**The Goal:** Develop and prototype a product based on extensive research and collaboration with a user group—In our case, urban librarians.

**The Outcome:** A prototype modular tree-shaped centerpiece that can [easily be reconfigured](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OO9_c6YrXYk) by library staff, built to collect and organize existing documentation and paper goods and inspire more public communications. Features seating and decorations to provide a comfortable and inviting environment for patrons. Asserts the value of libraries as meeting places of arts and culture.

**My Role:** Each member of the team contributed equally to the research and development processes. I additionally served as project manager, organizing and maintaining track of our team’s progress, and was largely responsible for product sketches and graphic design.

**The Process:** 

Once we identified our stakeholders—Librarians in urban environments—We first sought contacts for initial interviews.

Over the course of several interviews, we gained insights into the daily lives and experiences of our users, noticing repeated pain points, challenges, and joys.

We developed personas based on our users:
- "Sponge Steve" embodies a curious and knowledgable librarian who is enriched by research. He inspires patrons to explore new ideas and learn at the library, and enjoys keeping up-to-date on new technologies, ensuring that the library is always relevant. While his openmindedness keeps the job exciting after many years, he is challenged by the less "interesting", more logistical aspects of the job. He wishes patrons would enter more conversations about their interests and how the library can fulfill them, rather than asking for resources already described in written resources and FAQs.
- "Gardener Gail" is a people-focused librarian who loves to foster patrons' growth. She appreciates that libraries build a sense of community, and feels satisfied watching her patrons succeed. She is excited by the opportunity to run events and to make the library a dynamically changing space where people connect with others. She can struggle with staying organized and managing library operations, and is less interested in the more technical aspects of the job. She wishes more patrons would ask about hosting events and taking up home within the library space.
- "Handy Hally" recognizes that libraries offer critical services to those who need them. They love to help, and attempt to provide a broad range of services to as many people as possible. They like to leverage technology to improve library efficacy, but can become frustrated when half-baked tools are introduced. They are sometimes overwhelmed by the various unspoken responsibilities they have as a librarian. They wish that lawmakers and the general public recognized the urgency of information and technology literacy, and invested time and energy into supporting libraries as the premier place to learn freely.

After several iterations of ideation and co-design, we narrowed our idea to "A one-stop hub for library information that doesn't fade into the background". We attempted to maximize the best of our users' experiences—Enriching interactions with patrons and the interests they bring—and minimize repetitive questioning, confusion, and disinterest.

To draw attention and challenge the sometimes dull public image of the library, we decided to use tree imagery, which communicates growth and resilience while providing flexibility for each library to express its unique character. The modular design made of hexagonal cells made with natural materials allows for the centerpiece to be purchased, assembled, moved, and re-assembled easily without any technical expertise. We considered the attachments and features that would best replace library display tables and corkboards with a more engaging form factor. Librarians accumulate information and make it accessible to guests—The Orchard accumulates information about the library in an accessible and inviting manner.
